CHAPTER 1  What is the intelligent web?

is shown on the left panel.

like to have our binary files categorized in terms of the themes that we define—“Autos 
& Vehicles,” “Education,” “Entertainment,” “Politics,” and so on (see figure 1.5). 

 Similarly to other cases of intelligent applications, these categories may be struc-
tured as a hierarchy. For example, the category of “Autos & Vehicles” may be further 
divided into subcategories such as “Sedan,” “Trucks,” “Luxury,” “SUV,” and so on. 

1.3.6 Online gaming

Massive multiplayer online games have all the ingredients required to create intelli-
gence in the game. They have ample aggregated content and reference structures that 
reflect  the  rules,  and  they  can  certainly  use the  algorithms  that  we  describe  in  this 
book to introduce new levels of sophistication in the game. Characters that are played 
by the computer can assimilate the input of the human players so that the experience 
of the game as perceived by the humans becomes more entertaining.

 Online gaming is an exciting area for applying intelligent techniques, and it can 
become  a  key  differentiator  among  competitors,  as  the  computational  power  that’s 
available for playing games and the expectations of the human players with respect 
to  game  complexity  and  innovation  increase.  Techniques  that  we  describe  in  chap-
ters 4, 5, and 6, as well as a lot of the material in the appendices, are directly applica-
ble in online games.
