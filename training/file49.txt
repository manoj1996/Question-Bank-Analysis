6 Combining different scores. 

In section 2.4.3, we showed one way to combine the 
three different scores, in order to provide the final ranking for the results of a 
particular query. That’s not the only way. This is a case where you can devise a 
balancing of these three terms in a way that best fits your needs. Here’s an idea: 
introduce weighing terms for each of the three scores and experiment with dif-
ferent allocations of weight to each one of them. 

Provided that you consider a fixed network of pages or documents, how do 
the results change based on different values of these weight coefficients? Plot 20 
precision/recall values that correspond to 20 different queries, and do that for 
three different weight combinations, for example (0.6, 0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.6, 0.2), 
(0.2,  0.2,  0.6).  What  do  you  see?  How  do  these  points  compare  to  the  equal 
weight distribution (1,1,1)? Can you come up with different formulas for bal-
ancing the various contributions?
