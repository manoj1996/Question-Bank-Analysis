4.1.1 User groups on a website: a case study

The need for clustering

123

We’ll now introduce a simple case study that we’ll use throughout this section to illus-
trate clustering. Let’s assume that we work for a large open source community soft-
ware platform, such as SourceForge.net, and we want to know why people participate 
in open source projects. We could identify groups of users on the basis of their pro-
files by performing a cluster analysis. For argument’s sake, let us take the following 
attributes into consideration: 

■ The age of the users, which we’ll measure in years.
■ Their  income,  which  we’ll  measure  with  brackets  or  ranges;  for  example,  an 
income  of  $65,000–$80,000  corresponds  to  income  range  0,  the  range 
$80,000–$95,000 corresponds to income range 1, and so on. You can find all 
the details about the ranges and their values in the README file located in the 
data/ch04 directory.

■ Their education level; high school, college, graduate school, and so on.
■ The degree to which they consider their participation to be a good way of hon-

ing their professional skills; say, on a scale from 1 to 5.

■ The degree to which they consider their participation to be a good way of build-
ing social relationships with people who have the same interests as they do; once 
again, we could measure that on a scale from 1 to 5.

■ An indicator of paid participation, by which we mean whether an individual is 
getting paid to participate in the project. We could use a Boolean variable or we 
could create a finer-grained representation of paid participation by capturing 
the percentage of contribution time that’s paid by a third party. 

You can extend this example to any web application that involves a social networking 
structure by introducing the attributes that are most appropriate to your case. In order 
to make our example more concrete, we’ve created the artificial data in table 4.1. In the 
headers, you can see the six attributes that we just described. In each row, you’ll find the 
values of these attributes for each of the 20 users that we’ll consider.
