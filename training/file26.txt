present in the next chapters and, in particular, their relation with the fields of artifi-
cial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, and soft computing. 

 Finally, we presented a list of eight design pitfalls that occur frequently in practice. 
These  are  given  as  broad  empirical  guidelines  rather  than  as  rigorously  established 
facts. We believe that knowing these eight guidelines can save you a lot of time and 
reduce your caffeine consumption. In the rest of the book we will examine, one by 
one, a number of techniques that can add intelligent behavior in your own applica-
tion. Additional material for each of these techniques is provided in the end of each 
chapter in a “To Do” section.
