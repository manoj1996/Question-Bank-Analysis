CHAPTER 2  Searching

QueryParser class. Sometimes you may have to use different means for creating the 
Lucene Query. To search for the term “nasdaq index” and allow for the possibility of 
results  that refer to “nasdaq composite index,” you’d use the class  PhraseQuery.  In 
this case, the term “index” can be a term apart from the term “nasdaq”. The maxi-
mum number of terms that can separate “nasdaq” and “index” is set by a parameter 
called slope. By setting the slope equal to 1, we can achieve the desired result. For this 
and more powerful features of searching with Lucene, we encourage you to explore 
the Lucene APIs and documentation. 

2.2 Why search beyond indexing?

Now that we’ve showed you how to quickly index your documents with Lucene and 
execute queries against those indices, you’re probably convinced that using Lucene is 
easy and wonderful. You may wonder: “If Lucene is so sophisticated and efficient, why 
bother with anything else?” In this section we’ll demonstrate why searching beyond 
indexing is necessary. We mentioned the reasons in passing in chapter 1, but in this 
section we’ll discuss the issue in more depth. Let’s add a new document to our list of 
seeding URLs. Listing 2.4 is similar to listing 2.1, but it now includes a URL that con-
tains spam. 

Listing 2.4  Reading, indexing, and searching web pages that contain spam

FetchAndProcessCrawler crawler = 
➥  new FetchAndProcessCrawler("C:/iWeb2/data/ch02",5,200);

crawler.setDefaultUrls(); 

crawler.addUrl("file:///c:/iWeb2/data/ch02/spam-01.html");   

crawler.run(); 

LuceneIndexer luceneIndexer = 
➥  new LuceneIndexer(crawler.getRootDir());   

Build Lucene 
index

luceneIndexer.run(); 

MySearcher oracle = new MySearcher(luceneIndexer.getLuceneDir());   

oracle.search("armstrong",5); 

Add web page 
with spam

engine

Figure 2.4 shows the results of the search for “Armstrong.” You can see that the care-
fully crafted spam web page catapulted to first place in our ranking. You can create 
three or more similar spam pages and add them to your URL list to convince yourself 
that pretty soon the truly relevant content will be lost in a sea of spam pages!

 Unlike a set of documents in a database or on your hard drive, the content of the 
Web isn’t regulated. Hence, the deliberate creation of deceptive web pages can render 
traditional  IR techniques practically useless. If search engines relied solely on tradi-
tional  IR  techniques  then  web  surfing  for  learning  or  entertainment—our  national 
online sport—wouldn’t be possible. Enter a new brave world: link analysis! Link analy-
sis was the first (and a significant) contribution toward fast and accurate searching on 
a set of documents that are linked to each other explicitly, such as internet web pages.
