Clustering: 
 grouping things together

This chapter covers:
■ Understanding the need and value of clustering
■ Discovering user groups in a typical website 

and finding groups of similar news stories, blog 
reports, or documents.

■ Link-based clustering algorithms and the 

blazing fast k-means

Our ability as humans to accumulate and retain information relies greatly on our 
ability to structure the abundance of information that we receive through means, 
such as sensory perception, reason, language, and emotion. The profusion of avail-
able information would be overwhelming without some reference structures. Men-
tal  constructs  that  put  order  to  all  the  data  that  we  receive  help  us  retain  the 
essence of the data and understand the world around us. 

  Typically,  we  organize  our  perceptions  into  groups  or  categories.  Intelligent 
applications follow the same principles and achieve the same results by means of 
two  broad  categories  of  algorithms—clustering  and  classification.  This  chapter  is 
devoted to clustering algorithms; the next chapter is devoted to classification.
