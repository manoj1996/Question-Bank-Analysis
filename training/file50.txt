In today’s world, we’re overwhelmed with choices; a plethora of options are avail-
able for nearly every aspect of our lives. We need to make choices on a daily basis, 
from  automobiles  to  home  theatre  systems,  from  finding  Mr.  or  Ms.  “Perfect”  to 
selecting attorneys or accountants, from books and newspapers to wikis and blogs, 
from movies to songs, and so on. In addition, we’re constantly being bombarded by 
information—and occasionally misinformation! Under these conditions, the ability 
to recommend a choice is valuable, even more so if that choice doesn’t deviate sig-
nificantly from the preferences of the person who receives the recommendation.
