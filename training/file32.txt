Figure 2.4  A single deceptive web page significantly altered the ranking of the results for the query 
“Armstrong.”

It propelled Google from anonymity to world domination in that space and advanced 
many other areas of research and development.  

 Link analysis is a structural characteristic of the internet. Another characteristic of 
the internet is user click analysis, which is behavioral. In short, user click analysis refers 
to the recording of the user’s clicks as she navigates the search pages, and the subse-
quent processing of these recordings for the purpose of improving the ranking of the 
results for this particular user. It’s based on the premise that if you search for a term 
and find a page that’s relevant (based on your criteria) you’ll most likely click on that 
page. Conversely, you wouldn’t click pages that are irrelevant to your search term and 
your  search  intention.  We  emphasize  the  term  because  this  is  a  deviation  from  tradi-
tional applications, where the response of the system was based on the user’s direct 
input alone. If the application can detect your intentions then it has achieved a major 
milestone toward intelligence, which is the ability to learn about the user without the 
programmer entering the answer from a “back door.”

In our effort to search beyond indexing, we’ll present the link analysis algorithm that 
makes Google special—PageRank. The PageRank algorithm was introduced in 1998, at 
the seventh international World Wide Web conference (WWW98), by Sergey Brin and
