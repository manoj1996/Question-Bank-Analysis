What applications can benefit from intelligence?

“Weather.” Finally, most social networking sites are able to recommend to their users 
new friends and new postings that may be of interest. In order to do that, they rely on 
advanced  algorithms  for  making  predictions  and  abstractions  of  the  collected  data, 
and therefore contain all three ingredients of intelligence.

1.3.2 Mashups

The  IBM  DeveloperWorks  site  (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/spaces/mash-
ups) has a whole section dedicated to mashups, and the definition is particularly apt: 
“Mashups are an exciting genre of interactive web applications that draw upon con-
tent  retrieved  from  external  data  sources  to  create  entirely  new  and  innovative  ser-
vices.”  In  other  words,  you’re  building  a  site  by  using  content  and  UI  elements 
“borrowed” from others. Another interesting site, in the context of mashups, is Pro-
grammableWeb  (http://www.programmableweb.com).  It’s  a  convenient  place  for 
starting your exploration of the mashups world (see figure 1.3).

 In our context, mashups are important because they’re based on aggregated con-
tent,  but  unlike  social  networking  sites,  they  don’t  own  the  content  that  they  dis-
play—at  least,  a  big  part  of  it.  The  content  is  physically  stored  in  geographically 
dispersed locations and is pulled together from its various sources to create a unique 
presentation based on your interaction with the application.

 But not all mashups are intelligent. In order to build intelligent mashups, we need 
the ability to reconcile differences or identify similarities of the content that we try to 
collage.  In  turn,  the  reconciliation  and  classification  of  the  content  require  one  or
