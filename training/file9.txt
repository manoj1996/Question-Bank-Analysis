CHAPTER 1  What is the intelligent web?

more reference structures for interpreting the meaning of the content, as well as a 
number of algorithms that can identify what elements of the reference structures are 
contained within the various pieces or how content that has been retrieved from dif-
ferent sites should be categorized for viewing purposes. 

Portals
Portals and in particular news portals are another class of web applications where the 
techniques of this book can have a large impact. By definition, these applications are 
gateways to content that’s distributed throughout the internet or, in the case of a cor-
porate network, throughout an intranet. This is another case in which the aggregated 
content is dispersed but accessible. 

 The best example in this category is Google News (http://news.google.com). This 
site gathers news stories from thousands of sources and automatically groups similar 
news  stories  under  a  common  heading.  Moreover,  each  group  of  news  stories  is 
assigned to one of the news categories that are available by default, such as Business, 
Health, World, Sci/Tech, and so on (see figure 1.4).

 You can even define your own categories and determine what kind of stories are of 
interest to you. Once again, we see that the underlying theme is aggregated content 
coupled with a reference structure and a number of algorithms that can perform the 
required tasks automatically or, at least, semiautomatically.

 A promising project for building intelligence in your portal—especially for social ap-
plication kinds of portals—is OpenSocial (http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/)
